# Precision Farming Project - Frontend
This GitHub repository hosts the codebase for a precision farming project aimed at achieving the best product results with data-driven insights. The project is aligned with the problem statement outlined in [kluster.africa](https://www.kluster.africa/problem-statements/precision-farming-for-best-product-results-with-data).

# Problem Statement
Precision farming involves using data and technology to optimize various aspects of agriculture, aiming to improve crop yield and quality. The problem statement provided by Kluster Africa outlines challenges and opportunities in the domain, and this project seeks to address them through the implementation of a precision farming solution.

For more details on the problem statement, please refer to [Kluster Africa Problem Statements](https://www.kluster.africa/problem-statements/precision-farming-for-best-product-results-with-data).


## Project Overview
The project is implemented using Python, Django, and Django Rest Framework on the server side and React on the client side. As of now, the focus has been on developing the user interface and interactions.
